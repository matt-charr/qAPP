🎮 𝗾𝗔𝗣𝗣 𝑣0.3.3 is out.

◼️ 𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐬: https://lnkd.in/esYinwrZ

◼️ 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐥𝐨𝐠:

● Added a practical use case: 𝐷𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (*).
● Added option pricing framework with Fast Fourier Transform.
● Added pricing day counter input.

◼️ 𝐀 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞: 𝐷𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 risk profile.

● The contract is described in 𝑞𝐿𝐴𝑁𝐺 as:

𝘐𝘍(
 𝘔𝘐𝘕(
 𝘚𝘗𝘖𝘛("undl1", "2022-05-03") / 𝘚𝘗𝘖𝘛("undl1", "2021-05-03"), 
 𝘚𝘗𝘖𝘛("undl2", "2022-05-03") / 𝘚𝘗𝘖𝘛("undl2", "2021-05-03")
 ) > 𝘙𝘌𝘍("Strike", 1)
) 𝘛𝘏𝘌𝘕(
 𝘗𝘈𝘠(100, "2022-05-03", "cc1")
)

● The functions called in 𝑞𝐴𝑃𝐼 are:

● Below the results loaded into 𝑞𝐺𝑈𝐼.

- This a tiny frame of what you can do with 𝐪𝐀𝐏𝐏. 
Check out the examples in the package for more applications.
- Pricing a 𝐷𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 with 𝐪𝐀𝐏𝐏 is overkilled. 
It is meant to handle more complex custom derivatives.
- 𝑞𝐺𝑈𝐼 does not handle 3D visualization so we use slicewise plotting.
A way to achieve this is to use the upcoming python API.
