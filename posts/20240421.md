As one of my master used to say:

"𝐴 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑜 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙"

This is why any pricing results computed by 𝑞𝐴𝑃𝐼 comes with a confidence interval: <br>
● It is all the more necessary that this one can be significant for greeks. <br>
● The user needs to be aware of how stable the pricing results are with respect to the seed. <br>
● Playing with the antithetic factor option can help to reduce this uncertainty. <br>
● The results can be visualized with 𝑞𝐺𝑈𝐼, our up and running modern desktop application.
