# ðŸ“º How can I load my contract ?

> [!NOTE]
> Enjoy the below experience by opening the mockup <em>qa/mockup/how-can-i-load-my-contract.json</em> in `qapp` (See [How can I report my issue](../features/how-can-i-report-my-issue/doc.md))

1. Go to <em>Contract</em> tab bar item, set your pricing date to <em>2020-11-10</em>, your premium currency to <em>cc1</em> and your contract json file to <em>examples/autocall.json</em> then click on <em>load</em>. Be aware that your contract will be automatically moved to your pricing date (see [How can I move my contract ?](../features/how-can-i-move-my-contract/doc.md)).

2. You can now inspect the script, observe contract fixings and underlyings together with their correlation matrix, eventually you have a complete view on the contract past/future lifetime events i.e. fixings, payments, barriers, purchases, sells and also settings.

3. There are plenty of features to discover in <em>qalgebra</em>.
   You can try to load the contract cpp files:
- <em>examples/call_composite.json</em> to see how composite fixings works.
- <em>examples/digital.json</em> to see how buy and sell works.
