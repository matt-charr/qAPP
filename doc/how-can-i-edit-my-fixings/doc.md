> [!NOTE]
> Enjoy the below experience by opening the mockup <em>qa/mockup/how-can-i-edit-my-fixings.json</em> in `qapp` (See [How can I report my issue](../features/how-can-i-report-my-issue/doc.md))

1. Load the contract json file <em>examples/asian_call.json</em> (see [How to load my contract ?](../features/how-can-i-load-my-contract/doc.md)), set your premium currency to <em>cc1</em> and your pricing date to <em>2021-05-03</em>

2. You can turn a fixing from stochastic to deterministic and vice-versa: Go to <em>Fixing</em> tab bar item, set the first fixing at <em>100</em>, the second at <em>150</em> and click on <em>S</em> (save)

3. Observe that your contract has been modified accordingly.

4. You can turn back those fixings to stochastic by hitting <em>?</em> or edit them by hitting <em>E</em>.You can even do the same for past fixings if any.
